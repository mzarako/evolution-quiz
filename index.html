		<div class="solutions solution1 hidden">
			<p>Evolution is the change in gene frequency within a population over time. It cannot occur within an organism's lifespan. Although evolution can produce changes that seem progressive, such progress is relative to the current environment.</p>

			<h3>You are a peahen. You see a peacock with a large, symmetric tail. What do you think?</h3>
			<p class="right-answer"><button type="button" class="right-button">a</button><q>What a stud. Such symmetry must be a result of good genes!</q></p>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">t</button><q>What a stud. That tail will make a great privacy screen during mating!</q></p>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">c</button><q>No thanks. What a show-off!</q></p>
			<p class="right-answer"><button type="button" class="right-button">g</button><q>What a stud. He must be very quick and clever to have avoided attacks from predators.</q></p>
		</div>	
		<div class="solutions solution3 hidden">
			<p>A peacock&rsquo;s large, symmetrical tail actually signifies good genes in two ways. Symmetry displays genetic resilience to pathogens in the womb and the burdensome quality of having a large tail shows a certain finesse in the peacock&rsquo;s ability to avoid predatory attack.</p>

			<h3>What is one of the principle benefits of sexual reproduction?</h3>

		</div>	
		<div class="solutions solution4 hidden">
			<p>While it can be fun, the principle benefit of sexual reproduction is that it results in genetic recombination, which works like an encrypted password to prevent harmful pathogens from accessing offspring.</p>

			<h3>In which type of mating system would you find the highest level of sexual dimorphism?</h3>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">a</button>monogamous</p>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">t</button>polyandrous (one female, multi-male)</p>
			<p class="right-answer"><button type="button" class="right-button">c</button>polygynous (one male, multi-female)</p>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">g</button>promiscuous</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="solutions solution5 hidden">
			<p>Sexual dimorphism is most pronounced in species with polygynous mating systems. In these systems, access to females is an all-or-nothing game in which males engage in fierce competition and must constantly uphold their status. Thus, they tend to have sexually dimorphic traits, like larger size or enlarged canines.</p>

			<h3>Lions are polygynous, meaning their packs consist of one male and multiple females. When a new male lion takes over a harem, he will often kill any existing offspring. Why?</h3>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">a</button>The act is a final display of victory over the previous alpha male.</p>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">t</button>The act is a display of formidableness to attract the females.</p>
			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">c</button>By killing the existing offspring, he prevents his own future offspring from facing competition.</p>
			<p class="right-answer"><button type="button" class="right-button">g</button>By halting the period of female nursing, females will sooner go into heat and yield the new male&rsquo;s offspring.</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="solutions solution6 hidden">
			<p>The lone male in a polygynous group likely fought competitively for his position and will likely be replaced by an even more formidable male. Thus, the length of his tenure is unknown and he must make the most of it. Through infanticide he can sooner bring the females into estrus and pass down his genes successfully.</p>

			<h3>In humans, olfactory cues play a role in all of the following <em>except</em>. . .</h3>

			<p class="wrong-answer"><button type="button" class="wrong-button">c</button>attraction to genetically-distinct mates.</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="solutions solution7 hidden">
			<p>Body odor carries genetic information that assists us in a number of ways. Women, who generally have a stronger sense of smell, use it to determine if a partner is a good genetic match, and may choose differently across their menstrual cycles. A person&rsquo;s scent also helps us avoid inbreeding as we are not attracted to individuals with scent information similar to ours.</p>
